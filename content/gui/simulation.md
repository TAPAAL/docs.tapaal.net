In this section we will take a look at how TAPAAL can be used to simulate the behavior of a Petri Nets.
In simulation mode it is possible to simulate the behavior of the model by firing transitions and doing time delays. This feature can be very helpful to discover simple errors in your model by allowing you to examine if your model behaves as intended.

{{% notice note %}}
TAPAAL does currently not implement native simulation of colored nets. Instead it works by automatically unfolding the net.

You can active Simulation Mode by selecting ![Simulation](/gui/simulation-indicator.png?classes=inline) from the toolbar or from the main menu, `Simulator - Simulation Mode`. You can exit simulation mode at any point by clicking the button again. 

Switching to simulation will swap the content of the side menu and remove all drawing features.
Simulation features available depends on the modeling features enabled.

## Transitions Firring

In the canvas, enabled transition will be marked with a red color: ![Enabled Transition](enabled-transition.png?classes=inline). You can fire any enabled transition by right clicking it, after which the current state of the net will be updated. 

![Transition Firring](transitions-firring.gif)

The transition firring wide, in the side menu, will show a list of all enabled transitions (for all components). 
You can fire any transition from the list by double clicking it or selecting and pressing the Fire button.

## Simulation History

All transitions firings (and time delays) will be recorded to the simulation history widget. This is also used to display counter examples or traces generated by verification. 

![Simulation history](simulation-history.png)

You can step back or forward in the simulation history by selecting `Step backwards`/`Step forwards` from the simulator menu.
For convenience this actions is also directly assessable from the "Simulation Control" widget in the side menu ![Step back/forward](history-control.png?classes=inline), or by using left and right keypad buttons. 
You can also jump directly to any state by selecting it from the list. 

Warning, if you step back in the trace history and fire a transition it will overwrite the rest of the trace from that point on. 

## Time 
When enabling time you can how preform time delay actions as well as transitions firings. Like transition firings, time delays are recorded to the simulation history. 

On the canvas it will still show enabled transitions by highlighting them

![Delay Enabled Transition](denabled-transition.png?classes=inline)

The enabled transitions will now also show the time interval for which an transition can be fired, as well a transitions transitions that can be fired after some time delay.
