The current mode is indicated by the button in the toolbar, when pressed (as in depicted) the GUI is in simulation mode.\nIn the following section we will break down each of the main areas further.\nMain Menu The main menu contains links to all features in the program, and is handy for looking up shortcut keys (written left of the action).\n Main Menu Contains actions for opening, saving nets and for importing and exporting. The menu also contains the Example nets section, containing a number models showing off the features in TAPAAL. Edit \u0026amp; Draw Menu Contains features for drawing and changing nets, See more in section editor TODO: Simulation Menu Contains features used for simulation of nets, see more in section simulation TODO:  View Menu  Zoom: Controls the zoom level of the canvas Node Spacing: Add or remove spacing between all elements on the canvas. Grid: Cycle the grid size, including disabling the grid. Align to grid will move the position of all elements to align with the grid. Display: Show or hide specific elements in the side menu or drawing canvas. Change Visibility: Quickly change the visibility settings for all or selected parts of the current net. Workspace: Simple workspace is useful for beginners that want to hide as much complexity as possible. The advanced workspace will show all settings. Save Workspace will make TAPAAL remember your choices.    Tools Menu  Verify Query: verify the selected query, see section verification TODO: Net Statistics: Counts the number of places, transitions, arcs etc. in the net. Workflow Analysis: Open workflow mode, see section workflow nets TODO: Automatic Net Layout: Opens a dialog to automatically layout the components of the net. Merge Nets Components: Combine elements from components into a single component, see section editor for details about components. TODO: Unfold Nets: (Colors \u0026amp; Games only) Opens a new net where color and/or game features are unfolded. Batch Processing: Opens a specialized tool to run verification for several nets at the same time. See section batch verification. TODO: Engine Selection: Select a specific engine for verification, if you use UPPAAL for verification you will need to specify the path to verifyta here. Clear all preferences: Remove all stored preferences, on next star all settings will be back to default.   Help Menu Contains useful links to external resources related to TAPAAL including this documentation. Including developer credits and automatic version check.  Toolbar The toolbar contains a quick alternative to using the Main Menu for a number of often used tasked.\nThe toolbar can be divided into five main sections:\n Section 1  New net\u0026hellip; Open Net\u0026hellip; Save Net Safe Net As\u0026hellip;   Section 2  Print Cut section Copy section Paste content of copy/past buffer   Section 3  Delete Selection Undo last action Redo previous undo action Zoom Out Select Zoom level Zoom In   Section 4  Select grid size/disable grid Start/Stop Animation mode   Section 5 Draw tools, see details in section editor TODO:  Open tabs Contains tabs for each open model. Switch between models by clicking on a tab. Use the (x) to close a tab.\nSide menu / Workspace The the side menus content depends on the current mode (here shown edit mode) and selected modeling features. The menu consists of a number of widgets, specific widgets can be shown and hidden from the \u0026ldquo;View\u0026rdquo; to fit your need.\nIn general a widget is marked by a border. The top dropdown menu allows you to select between different modes or values. Below is a list of values. In the button row you can add, edit or create new elements by selecting a element and pressing the appropriate button.\nYou can resize a widget to fit your needs, by dragging the border with the mouse.\nYou can change the order of a list by selecting an element and using the up and down arrows to rearrange elements. You can sort the list alphanumerically by selecting the icon. Notice that the sort icon might be hidden on smaller screen.\nFor more details about features of individual widgets please consult the following sections: editor, simulation, verification, components, constants TODO:\nDrawing Canvas This is the place you can draw and simulate Petri Nets. In editor mode you can select any place or transition of the toolbar and click the canvas to place them.\nYou can connect a place and transition by an Arc, by pressing a arc button on the toolbar and clicking between an place and transition. To edit the properties of a specific place, transition or arc, you can double click it, or right click and select Edit\nNavigation If the net size exceeds the current canvas in size, you can use the scrollbars below and to the right of the canvas to move around. You can also navigate using the mouse scroll wheel or by right clicking and dragging on the canvas.\nZoom You can increase or decrease the size of elements on the canvas by using zoom. Select a zoom level from the toolbar or main menu, or zoom using hotkey Ctrl + mousewheel or Ctrl + J / Ctrl + K.\nGrid By default TAPAAL will align all components to the grid. You can customize the size of the grid using the View - Cycle Grid menu option or by selecting hotkey G. The grid cycles between 3 grid sizes and no grid. If a grid is used elements will automatically snap to the grid. You can also force all elements to align with the grid by selecting View - Align to Grid.\nSee more in section editor TODO:\nFeature indicator The feature indicator will display the current modeling features (and semantics) for the open net. You can at any time change the features available by clicking the feature indicator. A new net will be opened with the required modeling features enabled/disabled.\nIf you remove a feature, you will be prompted to confirm and the used feature will be removed from the net (best effort).\n"},{"uri":"/gui/editor/","title":"Editor","tags":[],"description":"","content":"To start editing a Petri Net, open an existing net using the open dialog, open an example net from the File - Example Net menu, or create a new net by selecting File - New net.\nIf you create a new net, select the modeling features you are interested in using. Depending on the features selected the GUI will adopt the available options.\nNormally you will select a draw tool from the Toolbar, or using a hotkey, you can lookup hotkeys in the draw menu.\n   Icon Tool Feature Hotkey      Select Any S    Place Any P    Transition Any T    Urgent Transition Timed Y    Uncontrollable Transition Game L    Uncontrollable Urgent Transition Game + Time O    Arc Any A    Transport Arc Timed R    Inhibitor Arc Timed I    Annotation/Note Any N    For details about the semantics of each elements please reference the corresponding semantics section: TODO\nDraw To start drawing select a draw tool from the toolbar, or using a hotkey. To place a place, transition or Annotation click anywhere on the canvas to place the element. For arcs, start by clicking a suitable start place or transition and clicking again to complete drawing the arc. The arc will automatically snap to any valid targe component.\nTAPAAL will always make sure that the net is syntactically removing the need to preform extra syntax checking. TAPAAL will prevent you for adding invalid structures and display an warning if you try to violate the syntax.\nPress Select or S at any time to go back to selection mode.\nQuick Draw When connecting an arc to a target, you can continue drawing an arc from the target location by holding ctrl while clicking the target. You can also press the canvas while holding ctrl to create a new place or transition and connect the arc to this.\nEdit Elements Places and transition, including there text labels can be moved by moving the mouse to then, holding down left mouse button and dragging the mouse.\nIn selection mode you can select a single element by clicking it, or multilabel elements by holding down the left mouse button and dragging the mouse. You can further manipulate the selected elements by holding Shift and selecting individual elements, adding or removing the from the current selection. Use hotkey Ctrl + a to select all elements.\nYou can delete the current selection by pressings Backspace or Delete or selecting Delete from the menu. You can move all selected elements by holding mouse down left mouse button and moving the mouse.\nClick anywhere in the canvas to deselect all elements.\nText labels related to places, transitions and arc, can be repossession by dragging them. They will maintain there position relative to the parent object. Place and transition names can also be hidden, by right clicking and selecting Hide Name.\nYou can edit an place, transition or arc by right clicking it and selecting Edit from the popup menu, or by double clicking it. This will bring up an menu that allows you to change the properties of the element. The options available will depend on the chosen model features.\nArc Path When drawing in arc you can curve the path of the arc by clicking the canvas, by default it will create a straight corner, holding shift will create a curved corner.\nAfter a arc is drawn a new path point can be inserted by double clicking the arc while holding down ctrl, or by right-clicking the arc and selecting Insert point.\nBy default arc points are hidden, by moving the mouse over an arc or by selecting an arc they will be displayed. You can select and drag path point to move the path of the arc. Right-clicking an path point allows you to remove it or change the curve type.\nComponents TAPAAL allows you to decompose larger models into components. Components are connected via shared places and transitions (draw with a dotted line):\nA share place/transition can be added to any number of components and thereby connect to components.\nNew components can be created in the Components section in the side menu:\nSelect new to create a new component, or select copy to create a new component based on the current component.\nYou can create new share places and transitions from the side menu using the Shared places and transitions section of the side menu. From the dropdown menu select either share place or shared transitions and select new.\nTo add an existing share place or transition to a component. Add a place or transition and right click and select Edit. Check the Shared checkbox and select a shared element from the dropdown. A new share place or transitions can also be created directly by pressing the make shared button.\nA component can be disabled by removing the checkmark in the components section. Disabled components are ignored in verification and simulation. This can be useful to create different implementation for a part of the system and swap between them.\nShared components can be merged into a single component by selecting Merge net components from the tools menu.\n"},{"uri":"/gui/simulation/","title":"Simulation","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"/gui/verification/","title":"Verification","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"/command-line/","title":"Command Line","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Command Line "},{"uri":"/","title":"","tags":[],"description":"","content":"TAPAAL This documentation site is Work-in-progress.
